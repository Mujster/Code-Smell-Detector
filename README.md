### Code Smell Detector for C++, Python and Java


### Introduction

In software engineering, writing a clean and efficient code is vital to ensure a maintainable and readable software system for future upgrades or bug fixes. Code smells are potential issues in the code which hinders the future development and maintainability of the system due to decreased readability. In this assignment, we were tasked to develop a smart code smell detector to detect code smells like Long Functions, God Classes, Duplicated Code and Large Parameters Lists. We developed this tool in MERN Stack to provide with an interface for ease of detection and usage. Our tool works for code written in C++, Java and Python.

### Code Smell Types

Types of code smells detected:

- Long Functions
- God Classes
- Duplicated Code
- Large Parameters List
- Magic Numbers
- Complex Nested Code
- Commented Out Code
